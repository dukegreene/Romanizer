The RomanizerÂ®

This program asks for an integer between 1 and 3000 and then
spits out the Roman numeral version of that number, using the
new-school (4 != IIII; 4 == IV') notation. 

I made it to get more comfortable with the integer division and modulus methods. I also learned a lot about getting my parentheticals straight.

To use the program, just enter an integer when asked. If it's outside the acceptable range, you'll be gently reprimanded and asked again.

This is the first Readme I've ever written. I don't know what else to say. So I'll stop.
